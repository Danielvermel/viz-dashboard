## Description

This small project is part of an interview exercise where I was tasked to developed a minimum viable product (MVP) of the Vizzly dashboard builder.

‚úÖ **The requirements for the builder are as follows**

-   The user should be able to create at least one of the following components from the data set we provide in the ‚Äúresources‚Äù section;
    -   Line chart
    -   Bar chart
    -   Pie chart
-   When building each component, the user must be able to;
    -   Select at least one field as the dimension.
    -   Select at least one field as the measure.
    -   Be able to choose between two aggregate functions.
-   The user should be able to add components to the dashboard.
-   The dashboard must have at least 4 cells.
-   One hidden ‚Äúeaster egg‚Äù feature which results in something cool happening.
-   A way of bundling the dashboard component, which can be installed into other projects if published to NPM.

üéØ¬†**Stretch goals**

-   Components on the dashboard should be editable once they‚Äôve been added
-   Support multiple component types; e.g Line and a bar chart.
-   Allow the user to add more rows to the dashboard
-   Allow the user to split and merge cells on the dashboard
-   Allow the user to customise the theme of the dashboard. For example;
    -   Setting brand colours
    -   Changing the font family
-   Making a shareable link to the dashboard - without persisting it ü§î
-   Drag-n-drop components around the dashboard
-   Support time dimensions in the components.
